        <h1>Name that Triangle</h1>
        <h2>A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different
            length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.
            Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.
            Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.</h2>
