    <h1>Bottle Deposits</h1>
    <p>
        In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. 
        In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit, 
        and drink containers holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit.</p>

    <p>Create a webpage that reads the number of containers of each size from the user. Your program should continue
         by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers.
    </p>
    <form>
        <input type="number" id="small-bottles" placeholder="small bottle count">
        <input type="number" id="large-bottles" placeholder="large bottle count"> <br> <br>
        <button type="button" onclick="calculateRefund()">Calculate Refund</button>
        <input type="number" id="refund"> <br> <br>
